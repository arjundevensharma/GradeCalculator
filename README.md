# GradeCalculator

## V1
Date: April 1, 2023.
Description: Academic average calculator from student data on Edsby. Throughout high school, I have always thought that a feature that shows a student average on the educational platform Edsby, which is used at my school, would be helpful. My initial prototype to institutionalize this feature is a Java program that, when given the raw data from the Edsby page showing a student's course marks, will extract and output the class name and will extract each individual marking and given their weightings will calculate and output the overall average in the course.

## V2
Date: October 5, 2024 
Description: Facilitated processing of multi-mark formats (% & [mark]/[mark] formats) of student data in Edsby.
